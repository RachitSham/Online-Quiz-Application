# Online-Quiz-Application

ğŸŒŸ  Code Flow:

ğŸ”¹  Main class starts â†’ Initialize QuizService.

ğŸ”¹ Load questions â†’ Shuffle order.

ğŸ”¹ Ask each question â†’ Show options â†’ Read answer.

ğŸ”¹ Check correctness â†’ Update score + feedback.

ğŸ”¹ After all questions â†’ Print final score and feedback summary.

ğŸŒŸ Purpose:

âœ… Packages (com.app.main, com.app.model, com.app.service)

ğŸ”¹ Organized code into Main, Model, and Service layers.

ğŸ”¹ Improves readability, modularity, and maintainability.

âœ… Class Question (Model)

ğŸ”¹ Holds question text, options, and correct answer index.

ğŸ”¹ Encapsulation: data is accessed only via getters.

âœ… Class QuizResult (Model)

ğŸ”¹ Stores total questions, correct answers, and feedback list.

ğŸ”¹ Used to separate result management from quiz logic.

âœ… Class QuizService (Service Layer)

ğŸ”¹ Loads sample questions into a list.

ğŸ”¹ Shuffles questions using Collections.shuffle() â†’ randomness for fairness.

ğŸ”¹ Runs the quiz: Displays questions, takes input, checks correctness, records results.

ğŸ”¹ Validates input: Ensures only A, B, C, D are accepted.

âœ… Class Main (Entry Point)

ğŸ”¹ Starts JVM execution.

ğŸ”¹ Creates QuizService, loads and shuffles questions.

ğŸ”¹ Calls runQuiz() â†’ returns QuizResult.

ğŸ”¹ Displays final score and feedback to the user.

âœ… Java Concepts Used

ğŸ”¹ OOP: Encapsulation (model classes), Abstraction (service layer), Separation of Concerns (layered packages).

ğŸ”¹ Collections: List for storing questions and feedback.

ğŸ”¹ Loops & Conditionals: Iterating over questions and validating answers.

ğŸ”¹ Scanner (I/O): Taking user input in console.

ğŸ”¹ Immutability: Fields like text, options in Question are final â†’ cannot be changed once created.

ğŸ”¹ I used ChatGPT to refine the grammar and structure of the key points explaining my code .

ğŸ”¹ For Code Review and for exception came in the application I Used ChatGpt.

ğŸ”¹ Additionally, I referred to GeeksforGeeks [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org] for conceptual guidance and coding references to ensure clarity and correctness in my implementation.
